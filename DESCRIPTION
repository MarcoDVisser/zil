Description: The zil package extends R with the Zero Inflated Laplace 
			 Distribution and provides functions for calculation of 
			 the density, distribution and quantile functions including
			 random number generation. The Zero Inflated Laplace is a 
			 flexible distribution used for e.g. meassurment error
			 modeling where where a fraction (1/(1+p)) of errors can
			 be zero, while also allowing for potential bias 
			 parameter 'mu') and large spread in errors (parameter 'b').
